This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in COBOL's PERFORM VARYING statement. The program intends to increment a counter from 1 to 10. However, the loop condition `UNTIL I > 10` may cause the loop to terminate prematurely or iterate one time too many depending on the compiler's interpretation of the condition, potentially resulting in an incorrect counter value. The solution shows how to correctly structure the loop condition to achieve the desired behavior.
